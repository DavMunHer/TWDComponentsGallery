            <p>Welcome to the Carousel Playground. Within this section, you have the opportunity to modify and
                personalize the various customizable properties of the component.
            </p>
                
                <p>For this specific component, you can
                set the maximum cards you want the carousel to show and adjust the scroll behavior if needed.
                For adjusting the scroll behavior (specifying the msPerMove and FirstMoveDelayMultiplier), you would
                have to add a provider in your app.config.ts file.
                Please note that the cards that this carousel uses can be customized with whichever card you need, which
                makes the component very reusable.
                </p>
                <p>
